    <h1 align=center>How To Use</h1>
<p align=justify>
This Is An Interface To A Constantly Running
Image Generator. It Will Generate Every Image
That Fits Into 65536 Bit.<br><br>
 <font color=#FF4040><center>Please Don't Hesitate - Play With The Controls.<br><br>
 <a href="#vec">New: Vector Mode</a></center></font>
</p>
<p align=justify>
In The Middle Of The Screen You Can See The
Picture That Has Been Generated In The Moment
Your Browser Started The Remote Control Applet.
By Pressing The Button <font color=#FF4040>UPDATE</font> The Applet Will Show The Image
That Is Generated In The Moment You Pressed The Button.
<font color=#FF4040>AUTO UPDATE</font> Will Switch The Applet To Another
Mode. It Will Perform A Slideshow, Using The
Number Of Seconds In The Textfield On The Right
As Interval Time.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The Generator Always Performs An Addition With
The Value One To The Actual Image For Producing
The Next One. This Generates Every Combination Of
Bits And So Every Possible Image. The Least
Significant Bit Alternates With Every Image And
The Most Significant Bit Has The Slowest Changing
Rate. Detailed Information Can Be Found In The
<font color=#FF4040>DOCUMENTATION</font>.
</p>
<p align=justify>
By Using <font color=#FF4040>RESOLUTION</font>, <font color=#FF4040>COLOR DEPTH</font>, <font color=#FF4040>COLOR(RGB)</font> And
<font color=#FF4040>GRAYSCALE/BW</font> You Can Change The Interpretation Of
The Bits. The Fastest Changing Part Of The Data
Set Will Always Be Choosen. Every Format Will
Produce Every Picture It Can Hold. If The
Parameters You Choosed Result In A Picture Larger
Than 65536 Bit, One Or More Of The Values
Will Be Truncated. Watch The Status Bar
Of Your Browser.
</p>
<p align=justify>
<font color=#FF4040>DIAGONAL</font> And <font color=#FF4040>SPIRAL</font> Are Algorithms Reorganizing
The Order Of The Pixels. These Algorithms Are
Unambiguous (One-To-One) And Produce Every Image Too But In
Another Order. This Is Also True If You Use Both
Together. (E.G. Try 150x150, 2 Bit Color Depth,
Grayscale and Both Mixers.)
</p>
<p align=justify>
<font color=#FF4040>SAFE SCALING</font> Can Prevent Problems I Noticed On A
PC Running Windows 98 SE With A Riva TNT Card
While Displaying Very Small Images. Normally It
Makes No Difference If It Is Turned On Or Off.
</p>
<p align=justify>
<font color=#FF4040>DEC</font>,<font color=#FF4040>HEX</font> And <font color=#FF4040>ASC</font> Show The
Actual Data Set Either In Decimal, Hexadecimal Or ASCII Format.
</p>
<p align=justify>
<font color=#FF4040>SOUND</font> Interprets The Data Not As A Picture But As A Sound. This Is Experimental. With Some Combinations
Of OSs And Browsers It Works Fine But With Others It Doesn't. The Selected Color Depth Will Be Used As Bit Depth
For The Sound File.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Use The <font color=#FF4040>CALCULATOR</font> Button To Upload A JPEG File.
A Second Applet Will Be Loaded. It Computes The Time Until Your Image Will Appear. Your Image Will Be Shrinked
To 64x64 Pixel / 8 Bit Color Depth / Grayscale Mode. It Makes No Sense Uploading Larger Ones But You Can Do It.
Pictures Larger Than 100.000 Bytes Or Files That Are No JPEGs Will Be Rejected. Please Be Patient, This May Take
A Long While.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The new <a name="vec"><font color=#FF4040>VECTOR MODE</font></a> Section Is Still Under Construction. But You Can Use It Anyway. Click This Checkbox To Enable The Vector Mode.<br>
<font color=#FF4040>Run</font> Loads A New Image From The Server And Performs The Desired Action On It.<br>
<font color=#FF4040>HiRes</font> Shows The Result In Maximum Resolution.<br>
<font color=#FF4040>show Structure</font> Draws All The Edges Over The Image.<br>
<font color=#FF4040>AllComb</font> Inserts Edges Between Every Point.<br>
<font color=#FF4040>ConvHull</font> Draws Edges Around The Point Set.<br>
<font color=#FF4040>Delaunay</font> Performs A Delaunay Triangulation, This Should Give The Best Results.<br>
<font color=#FF4040>Wireframe</font> Draws The Edges Into The Image.<br>
<font color=#FF4040>Shaded</font> Fills The Space Between The Edges.<br>
</p>
<p align=justify>
Please Send Me Your Message By Using The <font color=#FF4040>E-MAIL</font> Button.
