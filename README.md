ImageN is an art project from 2000 that works with the contrast of computability and complexity.

ImageN is an image generator that uses a single integer with an accuracy of 65535 bits to generate every possible image. The generator initialized the integer with the value 0 and now constantly adds the value 1 in order to generate every possible bit pattern and thus every possible image.

The generator is a tiny C programm calculating millions of patterns per second.

The original interface was a Java applet with many options to turn the pattern into images. Currently I can only provide a simple Javascript replacement. I hope to improve it in the future. The raw data can be accessed at .

ImageN was my intermediate diploma at the Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig (HGB Leipzig). It went online in July 2000. From 2004 to 2020 ImageN was offline most of the time.
