ImageN is an image generator that uses a single integer with an accuracy of 65535 bits to generate every possible image. The generator initialised the integer with the value 0 and now constantly adds the value 1 in order to generate every possible pattern and so every possible image.

The generator is a tiny C programm calculating millions of patterns per second. The original interface was a Java applet with many options to turn the pattern into images.

Currently I can only provide a simple Javascript replacement. I hope to improve it in the future. The raw data can be accessed at .

The generator started in the year 2000 but was offline from 2004 to 2020.
